# Fundamentals_tensorflow

### This repository provide the fundamental of Tensorflow starting from creating tensor's to making your own tensorflow models.üòç

## *Part 1:- [Tensor Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pravincoder/Fundamentals_tensorflow/blob/main/Complete_tenors_tutorial_notebook.ipynb)* 
*This is the most important section for everyone because it focuses on learning the fundamentals and understanding what operation are done in the ML model behind the scenes! So, before we begin constructing actual models, we must first learn about the fundamentals of Tensors and  Numpy.*
